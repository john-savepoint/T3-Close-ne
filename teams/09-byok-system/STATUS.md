1. **Key Validation**: Format checking and live API testing for OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic
2. **Secure Storage**: Browser localStorage with validation caching and expiration
3. **Professional UI**: Comprehensive manager component with validation status
4. **Settings Integration**: New API Keys tab in main settings interface
5. **Security Features**: Show/hide keys, clear instructions, priority logic
6. **Competition Ready**: Easy setup for judges to test with their own keys

**Technical Achievements**:
- Complete TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- Secure client-side storage without server transmission
- Real-time validation with provider APIs
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Integration with existing design system and patterns

## ❌ **Blockers**

**None** - Task completed successfully

## 📝 **Implementation Notes**

### **Key Files Created**
- `lib/key-validation.ts` - API key validation utilities
- `hooks/use-api-keys.ts` - Secure key storage and management
- `components/api-key-manager.tsx` - Main UI component
- `app/settings/api-keys/page.tsx` - Settings page
- `.changeset/byok-system-implementation.md` - Version management

### **Provider Configuration**
- **OpenRouter**: Primary recommendation, sk-or-* format, 50+ models
- **OpenAI**: Direct GPT access, sk-* format, fallback option
- **Anthropic**: Direct Claude access, sk-ant-* format, alternative option

### **Security Considerations**
- Keys stored only in browser localStorage
- No transmission to Z6Chat servers
- Validation cache expires after 5 minutes
- Clear user communication about security model

## 🔗 **Related Tasks**

- **Task 03**: OpenRouter API Integration (supports BYOK architecture)
- **Task 02**: Convex Auth (will integrate with key management)
- **Task 04**: Chat Streaming (will use stored keys)

## 🚀 **Competition Impact**

**Judge Experience**: Judges can now easily test Z6Chat with their own API keys without requiring our credentials, providing a smooth and professional demo experience.

**Competitive Advantage**: Professional key management system demonstrates enterprise-ready security and user experience design.
