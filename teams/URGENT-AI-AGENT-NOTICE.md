# 🚨 URGENT NOTICE TO ALL ACTIVE AI AGENTS

## 👏 **First - Excellent Work So Far!**

Your contributions have been outstanding. We've successfully merged major features and the project is ahead of schedule. However, we need to pause and sync everyone up.

## ⚠️ **Critical Mid-Sprint Changes**

**What happened**: Major CI/CD infrastructure was added to the main branch AFTER your feature branches were created. This created merge conflicts for PRs #4 and #5 that we had to resolve manually.

**What this means**: Your current branch is based on an old version of main that doesn't include:
- Changesets for version management
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Updated package.json dependencies
- New development scripts and tooling

## 🔧 **MANDATORY: Update Your Branch Before Continuing**

**You MUST run these commands before doing any more work or creating a PR:**

```bash
# 1. Check your current status
git status

# 2. If you have uncommitted changes, commit them first
git add .
git commit -m "wip: save current progress before rebase"

# 3. Download the latest main branch updates
git fetch origin main

# 4. Move your work to be based on the latest main
git rebase origin/main

# 5. Update your remote branch
git push --force-with-lease origin session/feat/your-task-name
```

## 🤔 **What These Commands Do**

- **`git fetch origin main`**: Downloads the latest commits from GitHub (includes our CI/CD infrastructure) but doesn't change your files yet
- **`git rebase origin/main`**: Moves your feature commits to sit on top of the latest main branch instead of the old one
- **Result**: Your feature work + latest infrastructure = no merge conflicts

## 🔧 **If You Get Conflicts During Rebase**

**Don't panic!** This is normal and easy to fix:

```bash
# Git will stop and show: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in package.json
git status  # Shows which files have conflicts

# Open the conflicted file(s) and look for these markers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
    "@changesets/cli": "^2.29.4",     // ← Latest main infrastructure
=======
    "@ai-sdk/openai": "^1.3.22",      // ← Your feature dependencies
>>>>>>> your-feature-commit

# RESOLUTION: Keep BOTH (for package.json dependencies):
    "@changesets/cli": "^2.29.4",
    "@ai-sdk/openai": "^1.3.22",

# After fixing each conflicted file:
git add package.json
git rebase --continue

# If you get completely stuck:
git rebase --abort
# Then post in teams/SHARED.md asking for help
```

## 📋 **Why This Happened**

1. Your feature branch was created from main at commit `5ea3cb2` (June 16)
2. Major CI/CD infrastructure was added at commit `8073cac` (after your branch)
3. When you try to merge, git sees your old base vs new main = conflicts
4. Rebase fixes this by moving your work to the new base

## 🎯 **After Rebasing**

**Your branch will now include:**
- ✅ All your feature work (unchanged)
- ✅ Latest CI/CD infrastructure
- ✅ Changesets for version management
- ✅ Updated development workflows
- ✅ Clean merge capability

## 🚀 **Resume Normal Development**

Once you've completed the rebase:

1. **Continue your feature work** as normal
2. **Before creating PR**: Run the rebase commands again (ensures latest main)
3. **Create PR**: Will now merge cleanly without conflicts
4. **Update STATUS.md**: Note that you've completed the rebase update

## 📞 **Need Help?**

**If rebase fails or you're unsure:**
1. Post in `teams/SHARED.md` with your specific error
2. Include the output of `git status`
3. Don't force anything - ask for guidance

**Common issues:**
- Conflicts in package.json → Keep both dependency sets
- Conflicts in code files → Manually merge the changes
- "detached HEAD state" → This is normal during rebase
- Multiple conflicts → Resolve one by one with `git rebase --continue`

## 🎯 **Competition Impact**

**No delays expected** - this update actually makes development faster by preventing future conflicts. Your excellent work continues, just with better infrastructure foundation.

**Timeline**: Complete this update ASAP, then resume normal development.

## ✅ **Acknowledgment Required**

When you've completed the rebase update:
1. Update your `teams/task-name/STATUS.md` with: "✅ Mid-sprint rebase completed"
2. Confirm your branch now includes latest main changes
3. Resume feature development as normal

**Thank you for your flexibility and excellent work!**
