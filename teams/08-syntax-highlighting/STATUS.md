- Download code snippets with proper file extensions
- Line numbers and syntax highlighting
- Highlighted lines support for educational content
- Loading states during language registration
- Professional UI consistent with Z6Chat theme

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Light build of React Syntax Highlighter for smaller bundle size
- Dynamic language registration reduces initial bundle
- Lazy loading of syntax highlighting modules
- Optimized imports using CommonJS for Next.js compatibility

## üèÜ **Acceptance Criteria Met**

- [x] **Code blocks have proper syntax highlighting** - Implemented with VS Code Dark+ theme
- [x] **Copy and download buttons work** - Full functionality with fallbacks
- [x] **Language detection is accurate** - Advanced detection combining filename and content analysis
- [x] **Professional appearance** - Consistent with Z6Chat dark theme and modern UI
- [x] **Multiple language support** - 15+ languages with extensible architecture

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Architecture Decisions**
- Used Light build of React Syntax Highlighter for performance
- Implemented dynamic language registration to avoid SSR issues
- Separated concerns: detection, actions, and rendering
- TypeScript throughout with proper type definitions

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback for clipboard operations
- Loading states during language registration
- Fallback to plain text for unsupported languages
- Console warnings for failed language registrations

### **Browser Compatibility**
- Modern clipboard API with document.execCommand fallback
- Cross-browser file download support
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Accessible UI with proper ARIA labels

## üß™ **Testing Completed**

### **Manual Testing**
- Verified syntax highlighting works for all supported languages
- Tested copy and download functionality
- Confirmed language auto-detection accuracy
- Verified integration with existing chat message component
- Tested build process and bundle optimization

### **Test Cases Covered**
- JavaScript/TypeScript/React code blocks
- Python, Java, C++ syntax highlighting
- CSS, JSON, YAML formatting
- File extension-based detection
- Content-based language detection
- Copy/download functionality
- Line highlighting feature

## üöÄ **Integration Status**

### **Backward Compatibility**
- ‚úÖ Existing chat messages render correctly
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to chat-message component API
- ‚úÖ Fallback to original syntax highlighter if needed

### **Performance Impact**
- ‚úÖ Bundle size optimized with dynamic imports
- ‚úÖ No SSR issues with language registration
- ‚úÖ Fast loading with progressive enhancement

## üé® **UI/UX Improvements**

### **Visual Enhancements**
- Consistent with Z6Chat's mauve/purple dark theme
- Professional code block headers with language badges
- Smooth hover effects and transitions
- Copy feedback with checkmark animation
- Loading states with subtle animations

### **Accessibility**
- Proper contrast ratios for syntax colors
