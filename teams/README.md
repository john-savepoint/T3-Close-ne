# Z6Chat ClaudeSquad Team Management

## 🎯 Competition Strategy: Parallel AI Development

**Timeline**: 48 hours | **Target**: Top 3 finish | **Approach**: 8+ parallel AI agents

## 📋 Task Assignment System

Each directory represents an **atomic development task** that can be completed independently by a ClaudeSquad agent:

### 🏗️ **Core Infrastructure** (Day 1 - Priority 1)

- [`01-convex-setup/`](./01-convex-setup/) - Database schema and configuration
- [`02-convex-auth/`](./02-convex-auth/) - User authentication system
- [`03-openrouter-api/`](./03-openrouter-api/) - Multi-model LLM integration
- [`04-chat-streaming/`](./04-chat-streaming/) - Real-time message streaming
- [`05-file-uploads/`](./05-file-uploads/) - Attachment system infrastructure

### 🚀 **Competition Winners** (Day 2 - Priority 2)

- [`06-resumable-streams/`](./06-resumable-streams/) - Upstash-based stream durability
- [`07-image-generation/`](./07-image-generation/) - DALL-E integration
- [`08-syntax-highlighting/`](./08-syntax-highlighting/) - Enhanced code rendering
- [`09-byok-system/`](./09-byok-system/) - Bring Your Own Key functionality
- [`10-web-search/`](./10-web-search/) - Real-time search integration

### ✨ **Polish & Performance** (Final Hours - Priority 3)

- [`11-performance-optimization/`](./11-performance-optimization/) - React optimizations
- [`12-mobile-responsiveness/`](./12-mobile-responsiveness/) - Mobile UX improvements
- [`13-accessibility/`](./13-accessibility/) - A11y compliance
- [`14-error-handling/`](./14-error-handling/) - Robust error management
- [`15-deployment-optimization/`](./15-deployment-optimization/) - Production readiness

## 🔄 **ClaudeSquad Workflow**

### 1. **Task Isolation Strategy**

- Each task works on **different files/components**
- **Minimal dependencies** between tasks
- **Git worktrees** for branch isolation
- **Clear interfaces** between components

### 2. **Agent Assignment Process**

```bash
# Copy prompts from task-prompts.md
cs  # Start ClaudeSquad
# Paste prompts into separate instances
# Agents work in parallel on isolated branches
```

### 3. **Integration Process**

- Agent completes task and creates PR
- Updates progress in their task directory
- CI/CD validates changes automatically
- Manual review and merge
- Other agents pull latest changes

### 4. **Progress Tracking**

Each agent updates their `STATUS.md` with:

- ✅ Completed features
- 🚧 In progress work
- ❌ Blockers or issues
- 📝 Next steps

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### **Minimum Viable Product** (24 hours)

- ✅ Working chat with multiple LLMs
- ✅ User authentication and persistence
- ✅ File upload capability
- ✅ Professional UI (already complete)

### **Competition Winner** (48 hours)

- ✅ Resumable streams (technical innovation)
- ✅ Image generation (user delight)
- ✅ Syntax highlighting (developer experience)
- ✅ BYOK support (judge accessibility)
- ✅ Advanced features (projects, memory, teams)

## 🚨 **Merge Conflict Prevention**

### **File Ownership Strategy**

- **Backend files**: Clearly assigned per task
- **Type definitions**: Additive only, no modifications
- **Components**: Each task owns specific components
- **Hooks**: Create new hooks, avoid modifying existing

### **Communication Protocol**

- Update `teams/SHARED.md` for any shared concerns
- Use GitHub discussions for cross-task coordination
- Mark dependencies clearly in task documentation

## 🏆 **Competitive Advantages**

1. **Development Speed**: 8x parallel development
2. **Feature Completeness**: Advanced features while others build basics
3. **Code Quality**: Enforced by CI/CD pipeline
4. **Professional Presentation**: Polished UI + robust backend
5. **Judge Accessibility**: BYOK removes testing friction
