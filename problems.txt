Now when I go to this website in incognito mode, https://v0-t3-clone-nine.vercel.app

I click sign in with github. It shows me this
Z6.chat logo
Sign in to GitHub
to continue to Z6.chat

(so it is showing the prod version)

After I sign in it takes me to this page
https://vercel.com/login?next=%2Fsso-api%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fv0-t3-clone-r9xecket2-john-savepoints-projects.vercel.app%252F%26nonce%3Dc521c2e0da85a1dbe9f9e1eab1c27fdbd11ed5befcc4635fdcf92352f5ef2437

which is asking to login to vercel.


To me, it looks like even though my settings on the OAuth app for production are set to the production where the dev OAuth settings are set to what you call the preview deployment site, even though when I sign in through the production GitHub area, it is still taking me to theThe Preview website. So I have a feeling you've screwed up something bad somewhere with Convex or Vercel
