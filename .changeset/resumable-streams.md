Add resumable streams feature with Upstash Redis persistence

This major feature addition provides Z6Chat with a killer differentiator - true resumable streams that survive page refreshes, network interruptions, and allow multi-device access. The implementation includes:

- Redis-based stream persistence with Upstash
- Background LLM generation independent of client connections  
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Multi-device stream access via session IDs
- Comprehensive error handling and progress indicators
- React hook and UI components for seamless integration

This gives Z6Chat a significant competitive advantage as no other chat application in the competition offers this level of reliability and user experience.
