- **Accents**: Purple highlights and borders
- **States**: Success (green), Warning (yellow), Error (red)

### **Typography**

- **Headings**: Inter font family
- **Body**: System font stack
- **Code**: JetBrains Mono
- **Consistent scale**: text-sm, text-base, text-lg, etc.

### **Component Variants**

- **Buttons**: Default, ghost, outline, destructive
- **Cards**: Elevated with subtle borders
- **Inputs**: Consistent styling across forms
- **Animations**: Subtle transitions and micro-interactions

## ⚙️ **DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS**

### **Primary Commands**

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start Next.js dev server
pnpm dev:convex       # Start Convex backend (separate terminal)

# Code Quality
pnpm type-check       # TypeScript validation
pnpm lint             # ESLint checking
pnpm lint:fix         # Auto-fix linting issues
pnpm format           # Prettier formatting
pnpm quality:check    # Run all quality checks

# Build & Deploy
pnpm build           # Production build
pnpm start           # Start production server
```

### **Git Workflow**

```bash
# Conventional commits enforced
git add .
git commit -m "feat(api): add OpenRouter integration"
git push origin feature-branch

# Quality gates run automatically
# - Type checking
# - Linting
# - Formatting
# - Build validation
```

### **Changesets Workflow** (Version Management)

**🚨 CRITICAL FOR AI AGENTS: You MUST run `pnpm changeset` before committing ANY changes**

**Development Process:**

```bash
# 1. Make your changes (code, features, fixes)
# 2. Before committing, create a changeset:
pnpm changeset

# 3. Interactive prompts (select exactly as shown):
# ✓ Which packages would you like to include? › z6chat (press space to select)
# ✓ What type of change? › minor (for features) / patch (for fixes) / major (breaking)
# ✓ Summary: Write a clear description of what you built

# 4. Commit BOTH your changes AND the generated changeset file:
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): your conventional commit message"
git push
```

**❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Forgetting to run `pnpm changeset` before committing
- Not committing the generated `.changeset/*.md` file
- Skipping the changeset for "small" changes

**✅ What Happens Automatically:**

- GitHub Action detects changeset files
- Creates "Release PR" with version bump + changelog
- Merge Release PR → automatic version update + GitHub release
- Your description appears in the changelog

**Manual Commands (for reference):**

```bash
# Check what would be released
pnpm changeset:status

# Generate version bump and changelog (automation does this)
pnpm changeset:version

# Emergency manual release
pnpm release
```

**Current State:**

- Version: `0.2.0` (automatically bumped from changesets)
- Changelog: Auto-generated with all recent features
- Next release: Will include all new changesets from AI agents

## 🚀 **MAJOR IMPLEMENTATIONS COMPLETED**

### **✅ Task 01: Convex Database Setup (MERGED)**

**Status**: Production Ready  
**Branch**: Merged to main  
**Impact**: Foundation for all backend functionality

**Key Achievements**:

- Complete database schema covering all features (users, chats, messages, attachments, projects, memories)
- Convex configuration optimized for competition needs
- TypeScript integration with full type safety
- All environment variables documented
- Sample functions for users and chats
- Ready for authentication and real-time features

### **✅ Task 02: Convex Authentication System (PRODUCTION READY)**

**Status**: Production Ready  
**Environment**: Both dev and production configured  
**Impact**: Complete user authentication with JWT tokens

**Key Achievements**:

- ✅ Convex Auth with Password, GitHub, and Google providers
- ✅ ResendOTP email verification system with custom domain
- ✅ JWT_PRIVATE_KEY and JWKS properly configured in production
- ✅ Schema updated with all required auth fields
- ✅ Production deployment successful with auth working
- ✅ Dedicated signup page with proper routing
- ✅ Authentication middleware and error handling

**Provider Configuration**:

- **Password Auth**: Email verification via Resend (chat@z6chat.savepoint.com.au)
- **GitHub OAuth**: Production ready with correct redirect URLs
- **Google OAuth**: Configured for multi-environment support
- **JWT Tokens**: PKCS#8 format keys generated and deployed

**Environment Status**:

- **Development**: perfect-fly-8.convex.cloud (working)
- **Production**: necessary-duck-420.convex.cloud (working)
- **Auth Testing**: Production auth system verified and operational

**Critical Lesson Learned**:

The email verification initially failed due to implementation assumptions instead of following official documentation. Context7 MCP usage revealed:

- Wrong flow parameter: `"signIn"` → `"email-verification"`
- Wrong field usage: emailVerified should be timestamp, not email
- Missing maxAge configuration for proper expiration
- Missing redirect logic after successful verification

This reinforces the MANDATORY requirement to use Context7 for all third-party integrations.

**Final Resolution**:

- ✅ Email verification flow working correctly with proper flow parameters
- ✅ Database fields using correct data types (timestamp strings)
- ✅ Redirect handling implemented for all authentication methods
- ✅ User experience complete: signup → verify → redirect to main app
- ✅ Cleanup functions to fix corrupted data and expired verification codes

**Latest Update (June 18, 2025)**:

- ✅ **Authentication Redirect Issue RESOLVED**: Fixed race condition where users remained stuck on login screen after successful authentication
- ✅ **AuthGuard Implementation**: Added consistent authentication protection across all application routes
- ✅ **State Management Enhancement**: Implemented proper authentication state monitoring with useEffect hooks
- ✅ **Middleware Consistency**: Updated route protection to include root path `/` ensuring consistent behavior
- ✅ **User Experience Perfected**: Seamless flow from authentication to main application with proper loading states

**Technical Resolution Details**:

The authentication system was creating sessions correctly but users weren't being redirected due to:

1. **Race Condition**: `router.push("/")` was called before authentication state updated
2. **Missing Route Guards**: Protected pages lacked consistent AuthGuard components
3. **Middleware Gap**: Root path wasn't protected despite being the redirect target

**Fix Implementation**:

- Modified sign-in/sign-up components to use `useEffect` monitoring `isAuthenticated` state
- Added `AuthGuard` wrapper to all protected pages (main, new, archive, trash, settings, tools, redeem)
- Updated middleware to protect root path `/` for consistency
- Eliminated race conditions by waiting for auth state confirmation before redirecting

**Result**: Authentication now provides immediate, reliable redirect to main application after successful sign-in/verification.

## 🔄 **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (CRITICAL)**

### **🚨 MANDATORY: Start Every Session With Git Status Check**

**BEFORE touching any code, you MUST run:**

```bash
git status
```

**Interpret the results:**

- **If on `main` branch**: Switch to a feature branch first
- **If on `session/feat/task-name` branch**: Follow rebase workflow below
- **If in a worktree**: Follow rebase workflow below

### **🔧 MANDATORY: Feature Branch Workflow**

**EVERY TIME you start work on a feature branch, you MUST run these commands:**

```bash
# 1. Check your current status
git status

# 2. Ensure you're on your feature branch
git checkout session/feat/your-task-name

# 3. Download latest commits from GitHub (safe - doesn't change your files)
git fetch origin main

# 4. Move your work to be based on latest main (prevents conflicts)
git rebase origin/main

# 5. Update your remote branch
git push --force-with-lease origin session/feat/your-task-name
```

### **❗ What Each Command Does**

- **`git status`**: Shows which branch you're on and if you have uncommitted changes
- **`git fetch origin main`**: Downloads latest commits from GitHub without changing your files (puts them in `origin/main` reference)
- **`git rebase origin/main`**: Moves your feature work to sit on top of the latest main branch
- **`git push --force-with-lease`**: Safely updates your remote branch with the rebased commits

### **🔧 If You Have Uncommitted Changes**

```bash
git status
# If this shows modified files, commit them first:
git add .
git commit -m "wip: work in progress before rebase"

# Then proceed with rebase workflow above
```

### **🔧 If Conflicts Occur During Rebase**

```bash
# Git will show: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in package.json
git status  # See which files have conflicts

# Open conflicted files and resolve conflicts:
# Look for <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, >>>>>>> markers
# For package.json: Keep BOTH dependency sets
# For code files: Manually merge the changes

# After resolving each file:
git add resolved-file.json
git rebase --continue

# If you get stuck:
git rebase --abort  # Cancels the rebase
# Then ask for help in teams/SHARED.md
```

### **📋 Updated Development Workflow**

1. **Start Session**:

   - Run `git status` to check your environment
   - If on feature branch, run the 4 rebase commands above

2. **Task Assignment**: Copy prompts from `teams/task-prompts.md`

3. **Before Starting Code**:

   - Ensure you're on latest main via rebase
   - Check `teams/SHARED.md` for coordination needs

4. **Development**:

   - Make your changes as normal
   - Commit regularly with conventional commit format

5. **Before Creating PR**:

   - Run rebase workflow again (ensures latest main)
   - Run quality checks: `pnpm type-check && pnpm lint`
   - Create PR with `gh pr create`

6. **Documentation**: Update task STATUS.md when complete

### **🚨 Why This Is Critical**

**Problem**: ClaudeSquad worktrees may be based on old commits (before CI/CD infrastructure)
**Solution**: Rebase ensures your work includes all latest changes
**Result**: Zero merge conflicts, clean integration

### **Conflict Prevention**

- **File Ownership**: Clear assignment per task
- **Type Safety**: Additive only, no modifications
- **Shared Communication**: Use `teams/SHARED.md`
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor `teams/PROGRESS.md`
- **⭐ NEW: Always Rebase**: Prevents 99% of merge conflicts

## 📚 **RESEARCH & DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Context7 MCP Workflow** (MANDATORY FOR ALL THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATIONS)

**🚨 BEFORE writing ANY code that uses third-party services, you MUST follow this workflow:**

```workflow
1. Identify Third-Party Service
   └─ Any library, API, or service not custom-built for this project

2. Resolve Library ID
   └─ mcp__context7__resolve-library-id with service name
   └─ Example: "convex auth", "resend", "openrouter"

3. Get Documentation
   └─ mcp__context7__get-library-docs with Context7 library ID
   └─ Use specific topic (e.g., "email verification", "authentication flow")
   └─ Use high token count (8000-10000) for comprehensive coverage

4. Analyze Patterns
   └─ Study the exact code examples from Context7
   └─ Note configuration patterns, method signatures, flow parameters
   └─ Identify any differences from existing implementation

5. Implement Exactly
   └─ Follow Context7 documentation precisely
   └─ Use exact parameter names, values, and patterns shown
   └─ Do NOT modify based on assumptions

6. Update Existing Code
   └─ If Context7 shows different patterns than current code, update accordingly
   └─ Document why changes were made (reference Context7 findings)
```

### **MCP Server Usage** (MANDATORY)

**🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ALL third-party service implementations MUST use Context7 MCP first**

- **Context7 MCP**: MANDATORY for ALL third-party services (Convex Auth, OpenRouter, Resend, Vercel AI SDK, etc.)
- **Brave Search MCP**: For troubleshooting and current solutions after Context7
- **Fire Crawl MCP**: For scraping official docs when Context7 lacks coverage
- **NO implementation without Context7**: Always check Context7 documentation before any third-party integration

**Context7 Usage Requirements:**

1. **Before ANY third-party implementation**: Use `resolve-library-id` to find the service
2. **Get comprehensive docs**: Use `get-library-docs` with specific topic and high token count
3. **Follow exactly**: Implement according to Context7 documentation, not assumptions
4. **Verify examples**: All code examples must match Context7-provided patterns
5. **Update approach**: If Context7 shows different patterns than existing code, update accordingly

**Examples of MANDATORY Context7 usage:**

- Convex Auth setup, schema, providers, flows
- OpenRouter API integration patterns
- Resend email configuration
- Vercel AI SDK streaming patterns
- Any Auth.js provider configuration
- Database schema definitions
- API endpoint structures

### **Key Documentation Sources**

- **Convex**: https://docs.convex.dev/

- **Numbers**: Sequential based on existing tasks
- **Names**: Kebab-case, descriptive, concise

#### **8. Integration Considerations**

- **File conflicts**: Ensure minimal overlap with existing tasks
- **Dependencies**: Clearly identify any blocking relationships
- **Types**: Only additive changes to TypeScript interfaces
- **Testing**: Include acceptance criteria that can be verified

### **Quick Task Addition Checklist**

5. Commit immediately for ClaudeSquad access

## 🚨 **EMERGENCY AUTHENTICATION DISABLE LOG** (June 18, 2025)

### **What Was Done - AUTHENTICATION COMPLETELY DISABLED**

**User Request**: Disable all authentication for competition submission due to persistent issues.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Middleware Disabled** (`/middleware.ts`):

   ```typescript
   // Before: Full Convex auth middleware with route protection
   // After: Empty middleware with no authentication checks
   export default function middleware() {
     return
   }
   export const config = { matcher: [] }
   ```

2. **Files That Still Need AuthGuard Removal**:

   - `/app/page.tsx` - Home page
   - `/app/settings/page.tsx` - Settings page
   - `/app/new/page.tsx` - New chat/tools selection
   - `/app/archive/page.tsx` - Archive page
   - `/app/trash/page.tsx` - Trash page
   - `/app/redeem/page.tsx` - Gift redemption
   - `/app/tools/layout.tsx` - Tools layout wrapper
   - `/app/settings/attachments/page.tsx` - Attachments management

3. **Authentication Infrastructure Still Present** (unused):
   - `/components/auth/` directory with all auth components
   - `/app/login/page.tsx` and `/app/signup/page.tsx`
   - `/components/auth-provider.tsx` in root layout
   - `/convex/auth.ts` configuration
   - All Convex auth tables in schema

### **How To Restore Authentication**

1. **Restore Middleware** (`/middleware.ts`):

   ```typescript
   import {
     convexAuthNextjsMiddleware,
     createRouteMatcher,
     nextjsMiddlewareRedirect,
   } from "@convex-dev/auth/nextjs/server"

   const isSignInPage = createRouteMatcher(["/login"])
   const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
     "/",
     "/new",
     "/archive",
     "/trash",
     "/settings(.*)",
     "/tools(.*)",
     "/s(.*)",
     "/redeem",
   ])

   export default convexAuthNextjsMiddleware(
     async (request, { convexAuth }) => {
       if (isSignInPage(request) && (await convexAuth.isAuthenticated())) {
         return nextjsMiddlewareRedirect(request, "/")
       }
       if (isProtectedRoute(request) && !(await convexAuth.isAuthenticated())) {
         return nextjsMiddlewareRedirect(request, "/login")
       }
     },
     { verbose: true }
   )

   export const config = {
     matcher: ["/((?!.*\\..*|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
   }
   ```

2. **Re-add AuthGuard to Protected Pages**: Wrap page content with `<AuthGuard>` component
3. **All authentication infrastructure remains intact** - just disabled
